## Question and Solution

If you have any questions, reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/namjujeong/).

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(price) FROM sales S
JOIN menu M on M.product_id = S.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id
````

#### Steps:
- Use **JOIN** to merge `dannys_diner.sales` and `dannys_diner.menu` tables as `sales.customer_id` and `menu.price` are from both tables.
- Use **SUM** to calculate the total sales contributed by each customer.
- Group the aggregated results by `sales.customer_id`. 

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

- Customer A spent $76.
- Customer B spent $74.
- Customer C spent $36.

***

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

````sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id
````

#### Steps:
- To determine the unique number of visits for each customer, utilize **COUNT(DISTINCT `order_date`)**.
- It's important to apply the **DISTINCT** keyword while calculating the visit count to avoid duplicate counting of days. For instance, if Customer A visited the restaurant twice on '2021‚Äì01‚Äì07', counting without **DISTINCT** would result in 2 days instead of the accurate count of 1 day.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | visit_count |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 4          |
| B           | 6          |
| C           | 2          |

- Customer A visited 4 times.
- Customer B visited 6 times.
- Customer C visited 2 times.

***

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**

````sql
SELECT customer_id, product_name AS first_item_purchased
FROM (
	SELECT customer_id, order_date, product_id,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS No
	FROM sales
	) AddNo
JOIN menu M on M.product_id = AddNo.product_id
WHERE No = 1
````

#### Steps:
- Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `ordered_sales_cte`. Within the CTE, create a new column `rank` and calculate the row number using **DENSE_RANK()** window function. The **PARTITION BY** clause divides the data by `customer_id`, and the **ORDER BY** clause orders the rows within each partition by `order_date`.
- In the outer query, select the appropriate columns and apply a filter in the **WHERE** clause to retrieve only the rows where the rank column equals 1, which represents the first row within each `customer_id` partition.
- Use the GROUP BY clause to group the result by `customer_id` and `product_name`.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | curry        | 
| A           | sushi        | 
| B           | curry        | 
| C           | ramen        |

- Customer A placed an order for both curry and sushi simultaneously, making them the first items in the order.
- Customer B's first order is curry.
- Customer C's first order is ramen.

I have received feedback suggesting the use of `ROW_NUMBER()` instead of `DENSE_RANK()` for determining the "first order" in this question. 

However, since the `order_date` does not have a timestamp, it is impossible to determine the exact sequence of items ordered by the customer. 

Therefore, it would be inaccurate to conclude that curry is the customer's first order purely based on the alphabetical order of the product names. For this reason, I maintain my solution of using `DENSE_RANK()` and consider both curry and sushi as Customer A's first order.

***

**4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**

````sql
SELECT product_name, COUNT(S.product_id) AS qty_purchased FROM sales S
JOIN menu M on S.product_id = M.product_id
GROUP BY product_name
````

#### Steps:
- Perform a **COUNT** aggregation on the `product_id` column and **ORDER BY** the result in descending order using `most_purchased` field.
- Apply the **LIMIT** 1 clause to filter and retrieve the highest number of purchased items.

#### Answer:
| most_purchased | product_name | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 8       | ramen |


- Most purchased item on the menu is ramen which is 8 times. Yummy!

***

**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**

````sql
SELECT customer_id, product_name
FROM(
	SELECT customer_id, product_name, COUNT(S.product_id) AS QtyOrder,
	rank() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY COUNT(S.product_id) DESC) AS PopularMenu
	FROM sales S
	JOIN menu M ON M.product_id = S.product_id
	GROUP BY customer_id, product_name
	) Final
WHERE PopularMenu = 1
````

*Each user may have more than 1 favourite item.*

#### Steps:
- Create a CTE named `fav_item_cte` and within the CTE, join the `menu` table and `sales` table using the `product_id` column.
- Group results by `sales.customer_id` and `menu.product_name` and calculate the count of `menu.product_id` occurrences for each group. 
- Utilize the **DENSE_RANK()** window function to calculate the ranking of each `sales.customer_id` partition based on the count of orders **COUNT(`sales.customer_id`)** in descending order.
- In the outer query, select the appropriate columns and apply a filter in the **WHERE** clause to retrieve only the rows where the rank column equals 1, representing the rows with the highest order count for each customer.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | order_count |
| ----------- | ---------- |------------  |
| A           | ramen        |  3   |
| B           | sushi        |  2   |
| B           | curry        |  2   |
| B           | ramen        |  2   |
| C           | ramen        |  3   |

- Customer A and C's favourite item is ramen.
- Customer B enjoys all items on the menu. He/she is a true foodie, sounds like me.

***

**6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**

```sql
SELECT customer_id, order_date, product_name
FROM(
	SELECT S.customer_id, product_name, order_date,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY S.customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS FirstOrderAfterMember
	FROM sales S
	JOIN menu M ON M.product_id = S.product_id
	JOIN members MS ON MS.customer_id = S.customer_id
	WHERE join_date < order_date) Final
WHERE FirstOrderAfterMember = 1
```

#### Steps:
- Create a CTE named `joined_as_member` and within the CTE, select the appropriate columns and calculate the row number using the **ROW_NUMBER()** window function. The **PARTITION BY** clause divides the data by `members.customer_id` and the **ORDER BY** clause orders the rows within each `members.customer_id` partition by `sales.order_date`.
- Join tables `dannys_diner.members` and `dannys_diner.sales` on `customer_id` column. Additionally, apply a condition to only include sales that occurred *after* the member's `join_date` (`sales.order_date > members.join_date`).
- In the outer query, join the `joined_as_member` CTE with the `dannys_diner.menu` on the `product_id` column.
- In the **WHERE** clause, filter to retrieve only the rows where the row_num column equals 1, representing the first row within each `customer_id` partition.
- Order result by `customer_id` in ascending order.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | ramen        |
| B           | sushi        |

- Customer A's first order as a member is ramen.
- Customer B's first order as a member is sushi.

**7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**

````sql
SELECT customer_id, order_date, product_name
FROM(
	SELECT S.customer_id, product_name, order_date, join_date,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY S.customer_id ORDER BY order_date DESC) AS LastOrderBeforeMember
	FROM sales S
	JOIN menu M ON M.product_id = S.product_id
	JOIN members MS ON MS.customer_id = S.customer_id
	WHERE join_date > order_date) Final
WHERE LastOrderBeforeMember = 1
````

#### Steps:
- Create a CTE called `purchased_prior_member`. 
- In the CTE, select the appropriate columns and calculate the rank using the **ROW_NUMBER()** window function. The rank is determined based on the order dates of the sales in descending order within each customer's group.
- Join `dannys_diner.members` table with `dannys_diner.sales` table based on the `customer_id` column, only including sales that occurred *before* the customer joined as a member (`sales.order_date < members.join_date`).
- Join `purchased_prior_member` CTE with `dannys_diner.menu` table based on `product_id` column.
- Filter the result set to include only the rows where the rank is 1, representing the earliest purchase made by each customer before they became a member.
- Sort the result by `customer_id` in ascending order.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | sushi        |
| B           | sushi        |

- Both customers' last order before becoming members are sushi.

***

**8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(product_id) AS total_item, SUM(price) AS amount_spent
FROM(
	SELECT S.customer_id, order_date, S.product_id, price, COALESCE(join_date, GETDATE()+1) AS JoinDate FROM sales S
	LEFT JOIN members MS ON MS.customer_id = S.customer_id
	JOIN menu M ON M.product_id = S.product_id) FinalTable
WHERE order_date < JoinDate
GROUP BY customer_id
```

#### Steps:
- Select the columns `sales.customer_id` and calculate the count of `sales.product_id` as total_items for each customer and the sum of `menu.price` as total_sales.
- From `dannys_diner.sales` table, join `dannys_diner.members` table on `customer_id` column, ensuring that `sales.order_date` is earlier than `members.join_date` (`sales.order_date < members.join_date`).
- Then, join `dannys_diner.menu` table to `dannys_diner.sales` table on `product_id` column.
- Group the results by `sales.customer_id`.
- Order the result by `sales.customer_id` in ascending order.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_items | total_sales |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | 2 |  25       |
| B           | 3 |  40       |

Before becoming members,
- Customer A spent $25 on 2 items.
- Customer B spent $40 on 3 items.

**9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier ‚Äî how many points would each customer have?**

```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(point) AS point
FROM(
	SELECT S.customer_id, 
	CASE
		WHEN S.product_id=1 THEN price*20
		ELSE price*10
	END AS point
	FROM sales S
	JOIN members MS ON MS.customer_id = S.customer_id
	JOIN menu M ON M.product_id = S.product_id
	WHERE join_date < order_date) Final
GROUP BY customer_id
```

#### Steps:
Let's break down the question to understand the point calculation for each customer's purchases.
- Each $1 spent = 10 points. However, `product_id` 1 sushi gets 2x points, so each $1 spent = 20 points.
- Here's how the calculation is performed using a conditional CASE statement:
	- If product_id = 1, multiply every $1 by 20 points.
	- Otherwise, multiply $1 by 10 points.
- Then, calculate the total points for each customer.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_points | 
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | 860 |
| B           | 940 |
| C           | 360 |

- Total points for Customer A is $860.
- Total points for Customer B is $940.
- Total points for Customer C is $360.

**10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi ‚Äî how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**

```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(point)
FROM(
	SELECT S.customer_id, join_date, order_date, price, S.product_id,
	CASE
		WHEN DATEADD(day, 6, join_date) > order_date OR S.product_id = 1 THEN price*20
		ELSE price*10
	END AS point
	FROM sales S
	JOIN members MS ON MS.customer_id = S.customer_id
	JOIN menu M ON M.product_id = S.product_id
	WHERE order_date > join_date) Final
WHERE order_date <= EOMONTH('2021-01-01')
GROUP BY customer_id
```

#### Assumptions:
- On Day -X to Day 1 (the day a customer becomes a member), each $1 spent earns 10 points. However, for sushi, each $1 spent earns 20 points.
- From Day 1 to Day 7 (the first week of membership), each $1 spent for any items earns 20 points.
- From Day 8 to the last day of January 2021, each $1 spent earns 10 points. However, sushi continues to earn double the points at 20 points per $1 spent.

#### Steps:
- Create a CTE called `dates_cte`. 
- In `dates_cte`, calculate the `valid_date` by adding 6 days to the `join_date` and determine the `last_date` of the month by subtracting 1 day from the last day of January 2021.
- From `dannys_diner.sales` table, join `dates_cte` on `customer_id` column, ensuring that the `order_date` of the sale is after the `join_date` (`dates.join_date <= sales.order_date`) and not later than the `last_date` (`sales.order_date <= dates.last_date`).
- Then, join `dannys_diner.menu` table based on the `product_id` column.
- In the outer query, calculate the points by using a `CASE` statement to determine the points based on our assumptions above. 
    - If the `product_name` is 'sushi', multiply the price by 2 and then by 10. For orders placed between `join_date` and `valid_date`, also multiply the price by 2 and then by 10. 
    - For all other products, multiply the price by 10.
- Calculate the sum of points for each customer.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_points | 
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | 1020 |
| B           | 320 |

- Total points for Customer A is 1,020.
- Total points for Customer B is 320.

**Rank All The Things**

**Danny also requires further information about the ```ranking``` of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ```ranking``` values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.**

WITH Final AS (
	SELECT S.customer_id, order_date, product_name, price,
		CASE
		WHEN order_date >= join_date THEN 'Y'
